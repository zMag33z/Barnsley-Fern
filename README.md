# Barnsley Fern

## Description
Computational design of a Barnsley Fern leaf.  In this lesson, offered by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com), I harnessed my JavaScript skills to create interactive web applications using the p5.js library, all within the Cloudflare CDN environment. While initially anticipating a Java-based tutorial, I leveraged my JavaScript proficiency to craft this dynamic, yet very engaging project.
