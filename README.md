# Barnsley Fern

## Description
Computational design of a Barnsley Fern leaf.  One of many Fractal Lessons offered by [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com). While initially anticipating a Java-based tutorial, I used JavaScript instead to craft this dynamic, yet very engaging design.  Leveraging the CDN - Cloudflare - P5.js library environment allows Javascript code to be transmutated into Java and be presented to the canvas.
